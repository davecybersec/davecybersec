crt.py is a Python script that extracts subdomains from certificate transparency logs. The usage is very simple. Run the script, and you will be prompted for a domain name. The script will then search crt.sh for certificate transparenct logs and attempt to extract any subdomains it finds.

This script requires the BeautifulSoup Python module.
