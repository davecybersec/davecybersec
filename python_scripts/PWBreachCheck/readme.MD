This script uses the HaveIBeenPwned API to check a password list for known breaches. You can edit the code to supply it with a .csv file of your choice.

This original POC was written with the concept of pulling the stored passwords from a browser and checking to see if any of the passwords were known to be compromised. If so, change these passwords!

You can supply any file you'd like, just make sure that the passwords are stored in a column labeled, passwords.
